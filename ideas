-todo: can't have more than 13 players

game flow pseudocode:

round:
(
initial deal:
deal 2 cards to each player

while 2 players are under 21 and haven't sat:
	for each player still in round:
		does player sit, take hit?
			set these options as object variables
	for each player taking hit:
		deal to player:
			total=sum of face values of cards in hand (use 11 for ace)
			if total>21:
				if ace in hand:
					total=total with ace=1
					if total>21
						player is bust
				else:
					player is bust
			elif total=21:
				player has blackjack
	if number of players with blackjack==1:
		that player wins
	else:
		draw		

after everyone either busts or sits
if sitting players=1
	sitting player wins
else:
	compare totals
		if 2 players are equal highest:
			draw
)
